# Impurity model
 
Calculate many-body states of an impurity Anderson model and spectra (e.g. XPS, XAS).

Depends (at the moment) on the open-source code RSPt.

Examples scripts are stored in the `script` folder.

For the Fortran module to work, compilation of the source code is necessary:
```
f2py -c -m removecreate removecreate.f90
```

Credits to Petter SÃ¤terskog for inspiration and for some of the (key) functionality.
